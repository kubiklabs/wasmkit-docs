# Contract

## Contract class

Contract class is used to create an object which does operations related to a contract such as deploying, interacting with network. One can also list query, execute methods available for the contract using this class.

**Constructor**

Contract constructor requires 1 argument, contract name. If contract `.wasm` file is not present in artifacts then this constructor will throw an error.

<CH.Code lineNumbers={true}>
```js
const contract = new CounterContract();
```
</CH.Code>

**deploy()**

Deploys the contract.

<CH.Code lineNumbers={true}>
```js
const deploy_response = await contract.deploy(contract_owner);
```
</CH.Code>

Gives following response:

<CH.Code lineNumbers={true}>
```js
{
  codeId: <code-id-val>,
  contractCodeHash: <code-hash-val>,
  deployTimestamp: <timestamp>
}
```
</CH.Code>

**instantiate()**

Instantiate the contract.

<CH.Code lineNumbers={true}>
```js
const contract_info = await contract.instantiate(
  {
    "name": "ERC20", "symbol": "ERC", "decimals": 10,
    "initial_balances": [{
      "address": contract_owner.account.address,
      "amount": "100000000"
    }]
  }, "deploy test", contract_owner);
```
</CH.Code>

Gives following response:

<CH.Code lineNumbers={true}>
```js
{
  contractAddress: <contract-address>,
  instantiateTimestamp: <timestamp>
}
```
</CH.Code>

To list contract's execute methods, print `contract.tx`.

<CH.Code lineNumbers={true}>
```js
wasmkit> contract.tx
{ Approve: [Function (anonymous)], Transfer: [Function (anonymous), TransferFrom: [Function (anonymous), Burn: [Function (anonymous)] }
```
</CH.Code>

**query methods**

To list contract's query methods, print `contract.query`.

<CH.Code lineNumbers={true}>
```js
wasmkit> contract.query
{ Balance: [Function (anonymous), Allowance: [Function (anonymous)] }
```
</CH.Code>
