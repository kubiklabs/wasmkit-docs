# Localnet with Wasmkit

## Running the docker container

The developer blockchain is configured to run inside a docker container. Install Docker for your environment.

Start a local node using:

```bash
wasmkit localnet-start <node-type>

wasmkit localnet-start neutron # example
```

There is a prebuilt docker image for you to use. This will start a container with a seeded user. The prefunded accounts are present in the default `wasmkit.config.js` file.

Check list of running networks:

```bash
wasmkit localnet-list
```

Stop a running node:

```bash
wasmkit localnet-stop neutron
```

## Checking node info

We can then check the node info of the node:

```bash
wasmkit node-info --network localnet
```

## Compile the contracts

Then we need to compile the contract. This can be done by following:

```bash
wasmkit compile
```

## Running scripts on local network

To run any script on localnet:

```bash
wasmkit run scripts/sample-script.ts --network localnet
```
