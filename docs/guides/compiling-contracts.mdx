# Compiling your contracts

Compiling contracts can be done using the command `wasmkit compile`.

## Compile all contracts

```bash
wasmkit compile
```

It compiles all the contracts in the `contracts/` directory. For each contract compiled, corresponding `.wasm` file is stored in the `artifacts/contracts` directory created in project's root directory.

## Compile specific contract

To compile only one contract or a subset of all contracts in the `contract/` directory, use:

```bash
wasmkit compile <sourcePaths>
```

Compile one contract:

```bash
wasmkit compile contracts/counter
```

Compile multiple contracts:

```bash
wasmkit compile contracts/counter contracts/cw20
```

## Schema generation

Schema is also generated alongside the compiled `.wasm` file for each of the contract compiled using `wasmkit compile` command. Schema files are `.json` files stored inside `artifacts/schema/` directory.

In the `typescript_schema` directory of `artifacts/`, the typescript classes for each of the contracts' client object which can be imported into scripts and tests (`.ts`) as seen in the samples.

Single contract `artifacts/` directory structure:

```bash
artifacts
├── contracts
│   └── counter.wasm
├── schema
│   └── counter
# mark
│       ├── execute_msg.json
# mark
│       ├── instantiate_msg.json
# mark
│       └── query_msg.json
└── typescript_schema
# mark
    └── CounterContract.ts

5 directories, 5 files
```

To skip schema generation while compiling, use:

```bash
wasmkit compile --skip-schema
```
