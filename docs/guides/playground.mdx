# Playground

Wasmkit playground is an auto-generated minimal front-end for interacting with deployed contracts. Since wasmkit keeps track of the deployed contract addresses on multiple networks, it can generate the playground front-end using these addresses and the typescript schema generated from the contracts.

Playground can be useful when quickly interacting with contracts either for debugging purposes or it can be shared as part of contract documentation for anyone to try out contracts interaction without having to setup environment or installing any cli.

## Building plaground

To initiate wamskit playground, make sure you are in project directory and contracts are compiled and instantiated using compile and run commands of wasmkit respectively.

```bash
cd <project-name>
npx wasmkit playground
```

This command will clone a react application to interact with deployed contracts. User can also modify its theme and logo using config file.

## Running Playground

Locally run the playground front-end using:

```bash
cd playground/
yarn start
```
