# Testing contracts

Contracts can be tested in two ways, one by writing rust tests in the `contract.rs` file itself, and other way is to write a mocha test script that interacts with deployed contract and assert the returned values. There are examples for both in the `sample-project` created after `wasmkit init` step.

## Rust tests

These tests can be run by going into the contract's directory having `Cargo.toml` file and running the command `cargo test`.

## Client interaction tests

These tests can be run by running the command `wasmkit test --network <network-name>`.

## Test scripts

wasmkit has support for user to write tests on top of js interactions with the deployed contract instance. These scripts are stored in the `test/` directory in the project's root directory.

A wasmkit test script has the same structure as a mocha test file with `describe` and `it` blocks, a sample test is explained below:

```js
import { use } from "chai";
import { getAccountByName, wasmkitChai } from "wasmkit";

import { CounterContract } from "../artifacts/typescript_schema/Counter";

use(wasmkitChai);

describe("counter", () => {

  async function setup() {
    const contract_owner = getAccountByName("account_0");
    const counter_contract = new CounterContract();
    await counter_contract.setUpclient();

    return { contract_owner, counter_contract };
  }

  it("deploy and init", async () => {
    const runTs = String(new Date());
    const { contract_owner, counter_contract } = await setup();
    const deploy_response = await counter_contract.deploy(
      contract_owner,
      { // custom fees
        amount: [{ amount: "90000", denom: "ujunox" }],
        gas: "35000000",
      }
    );
    console.log(deploy_response);
    const contract_info = await counter_contract.instantiate(
      {
        "count": 102
      }, `deploy test ${runTs}`, contract_owner);
    console.log(contract_info);
  });
});
```

Following is a breakdown of the above script:

+ Import `expect` and `use` from chai, `Contract`, `getAccountByName` and `wasmkitChai` from wasmkit and add wasmkit asserts to chai using `use(wasmkitChai)`.

```js
import { use } from "chai";
import { getAccountByName, wasmkitChai } from "wasmkit";

import { CounterContract } from "../artifacts/typescript_schema/Counter";

use(wasmkitChai);
```

+ `setup()` method does the initial common steps for each test, such as creating `Account` objects, creating `Contract` objects, parsing contract's schema files and deploying the contract.

```js
async function setup() {
  const contract_owner = getAccountByName("account_0");
  const counter_contract = new CounterContract();
  await counter_contract.setUpclient();

  return { contract_owner, counter_contract };
}
```

+ First test: Deploys and inits the contract . wasmkit automatically creates dynamic label for test deploys, which means that below label "deploy test" is not used instead "deploy <contract_name> <curr_ts>" is used which is always unique, so you don't have to manually change label for each test run.

**Note:** It is fine to have `deploy`, `instantiate` in each test as they are not executed multiple times for a given contract. Moving these steps in the `setup()` method is fine.

## Chai matchers

A set of chai matchers, makes your test easy to write and read. Before you can start using the matchers, you have to tell chai to use the wasmkitChai plugin:

```js
const { expect, use } = require("chai");
const { getAccountByName, wasmkitChai } = require("wasmkit");

use(wasmkitChai);
```

Below is the list of available matchers:

+ **Execution Response**

Testing what response was received after transaction execution:

```js
await expect(contract.balance({ "address": contract_owner.account.address })).to.respondWith({"balance": "50000000"});
```
