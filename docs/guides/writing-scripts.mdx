# Writing scripts

## Sample script walkthrough

Wasmkit boilerplate code has sample script `scripts/sample-script.ts` with following content: 

<CH.Code lineNumbers={true}>
```js
import { getAccountByName } from "@kubiklabs/wasmkit";

import { CounterContract } from "../artifacts/typescript_schema/CounterContract";

export default async function run () {
  const runTs = String(new Date());
  const contract_owner = await getAccountByName("account_0");
  const counter_contract = new CounterContract();
  await counter_contract.setupClient();

  const deploy_response = await counter_contract.deploy(
    contract_owner,
  );
  console.log(deploy_response);

  const contract_info = await counter_contract.instantiate(
    {
      "count": 102,
    },
    `deploy test ${runTs}`,
    contract_owner,
    undefined,  // transferAmount
    // customFees, // custom fees here
  );
  console.log(contract_info);

  const inc_response = await counter_contract.increment({account: contract_owner});
  console.log(inc_response);

  const response = await counter_contract.getCount();
  console.log(response);

  const ex_response = await counter_contract.increment(
    {
      account: contract_owner,
    }
  );
  console.log(ex_response);
}
```
</CH.Code>

## Importing wasmkit, contract clients

1. Import `getAccountByName` method from `@kubiklabs/wasmkit` library.
2. Import `CounterContract` client class.

<CH.Code lineNumbers={true} style={{width: "100%"}}>
```js focus=1:3
import { getAccountByName } from "@kubiklabs/wasmkit";

import { CounterContract } from "../artifacts/typescript_schema/CounterContract";

export default async function run () {
  const runTs = String(new Date());
  const contract_owner = await getAccountByName("account_0");
  const counter_contract = new CounterContract();
  await counter_contract.setupClient();

  const deploy_response = await counter_contract.deploy(
    contract_owner,
  );
  console.log(deploy_response);

  const contract_info = await counter_contract.instantiate(
    {
      "count": 102,
    },
    `deploy test ${runTs}`,
    contract_owner,
    undefined,  // transferAmount
    // customFees, // custom fees here
  );
  console.log(contract_info);

  const inc_response = await counter_contract.increment({account: contract_owner});
  console.log(inc_response);

  const response = await counter_contract.getCount();
  console.log(response);

  const ex_response = await counter_contract.increment(
    {
      account: contract_owner,
    }
  );
  console.log(ex_response);
}
```
</CH.Code>

## Load accounts, contracts

1. Fetch details of account `account_0` into `contract_owner` object.
2. Create contract client instance of `CounterContract`.
3. Connect contract client with the network.

<CH.Code lineNumbers={true}>
```js focus=7:9
```
</CH.Code>

---

## Deploy, init the contract

1. Deploy the contract. Network is specified in the `wasmkit run scripts/<script-name> --network <network-name>` command.
2. Instantiate contract instance with initMsg, label and signing account. Any funds to send with initMsg and custom gas fees is optional.

<CH.Code lineNumbers={true}>
```js focus=11:25
```
</CH.Code>

---

## Execute a contract transaction

1. Execute `increment()` transaction using account `contract_owner`. Any funds to send with execMsg and custom gas fees is optional. Refer to WasmKit library API for detailed execute call.

<CH.Code lineNumbers={true}>
```js focus=27:28
```
</CH.Code>

---

## Query the contract

1. Fetch count value using query `getCount()`.  Refer to WasmKit library API for detailed query call.

<CH.Code lineNumbers={true}>
```js focus=30:31
```
</CH.Code>

## Wasmkit Runtime Environment

Wasmkit runtime environment is used internally by Wasmkit. It is created when a wasmkit task is executed using bash command `wasmkit ...` which can be accessed in REPL using `env` variable and has following parameters:

1. **config**: Has paths of config file, contract sources, artifacts, project root and test path. Other config values such as networks config and mocha timeout.

2. **runtimeArgs**: Runtime metadata such as network to use etc. Network can be specified in a wasmkit command like `wasmkit ... --network <network-name>`.

3. **tasks**: List of available tasks with details.

4. **network**: Details of the network currently being used.

## Checkpoints

Checkpoints store the metadata of contract instance on the network. It stores the deploy metadata (`codeId`, `contractCodeHash`, `deployTimestamp`) and instantiate metadata (`contractAddress`, `instantiateTimestamp`). This comes handy when a script is run which deploys, inits and does some interactions with the contracts. 

Suppose the script fails after init step and now script is to be rerun after some fixes in the contract, here one does not want for the contract to be deployed and instantiated again, so wasmkit picks up the saved metadata from checkpoints file and directly skips to part after init and uses the previously deployed instance and user does not have to pay the extra gas and wait extra time to deploy, init the contract again. Same happens when there is error before init and rerun skips deploy and directly executes init step.

To skip using checkpoints when running script, use:

```bash
wasmkit run <script-path> --skip-checkpoints
```
