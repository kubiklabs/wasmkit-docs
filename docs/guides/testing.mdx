# Testing contracts

Contracts can be tested in two ways, one by writing rust tests in the `contract.rs` file itself, and other way is to write a mocha test script that interacts with deployed contract and assert the returned values. There are examples for both in the `sample-project` created after `wasmkit init` step.

## Rust tests

These tests can be run by going into the contract's directory having `Cargo.toml` file and running:

```bash
cargo test
```

## Client interaction tests

These tests can be run by running:

```bash
wasmkit test --network <network-name>
```

## Test scripts

Wasmkit has support for user to write tests on top of js interactions with the deployed contract instance. These scripts are stored in the `test/` directory in the project's root directory.

A wasmkit test script has the same structure as a mocha test file with `describe` and `it` blocks, a sample test is explained below:

<CH.Code lineNumbers={true}>
```js
import { use } from "chai";
import { getAccountByName, wasmKitChai } from "@kubiklabs/wasmkit";

import { CounterContract } from "../artifacts/typescript_schema/CounterContract";

use(wasmKitChai);

describe("counter", () => {
  async function setup() {
    const contract_owner = await getAccountByName("account_0");
    const contract = new CounterContract();
    await contract.setupClient();

    return { contract_owner, contract };
  }

  it("deploy and init", async () => {
    const runTs = String(new Date());
    const { contract_owner, contract } = await setup();
    const deploy_response = await contract.deploy(
      contract_owner,
      { // custom fees
        amount: [{ amount: "90000", denom: "untrn" }],
        gas: "35000000",
      }
    );
    console.log(deploy_response);

    const contract_info = await contract.instantiate(
      {
        "count": 102,
      },
      `deploy test ${runTs}`,
      contract_owner,
      undefined, // tokens to tranfer
      // customFees, // custom fess here
    );
    console.log(contract_info);
  });
});
```
</CH.Code>

Following is a breakdown of the above script:

+ Import `expect` and `use` from chai, `Contract`, `getAccountByName` and `wasmkitChai` from wasmkit and add wasmkit asserts to chai using `use(wasmkitChai)`.

<CH.Code lineNumbers={true}>
```js
import { use } from "chai";
import { getAccountByName, wasmKitChai } from "@kubiklabs/wasmkit";

import { CounterContract } from "../artifacts/typescript_schema/CounterContract";

use(wasmKitChai);
```
</CH.Code>

+ `setup()` method does the initial common steps for each test, such as creating `Account` objects, creating `Contract` objects, parsing contract's schema files and deploying the contract.

<CH.Code lineNumbers={true}>
```js
async function setup() {
  const contract_owner = await getAccountByName("account_0");
  const contract = new CounterContract();
  await contract.setupClient();

  return { contract_owner, contract };
}
```
</CH.Code>

{/* + First test: Deploys and inits the contract . wasmkit automatically creates dynamic label for test deploys, which means that below label "deploy test" is not used instead "deploy <contract_name> <curr_ts>" is used which is always unique, so you don't have to manually change label for each test run. */}

**Note:** It is fine to have `deploy`, `instantiate` in each test as they are not executed multiple times for a given contract. Moving these steps in the `setup()` method is fine.

## Chai matchers

A set of chai matchers, makes your test easy to write and read. Before you can start using the matchers, you have to tell chai to use the wasmkitChai plugin:

<CH.Code lineNumbers={true}>
```js
import { use, expect } from "chai";
import { getAccountByName, wasmKitChai } from "@kubiklabs/wasmkit";

use(wasmKitChai);
```
</CH.Code>

Below is the list of available matchers:

### 1. Execution Response

Testing what response was received after transaction execution:

<CH.Code lineNumbers={true}>
```js
await expect(
  contract.balance({ "address": contract_owner.account.address })
).to.respondWith({"balance": "50000000"});
```
</CH.Code>
